            I am using html table and css, I am trying to add border for table, I added the border but is display border width 100%, because i am using display:block;

            If I replace display:block to display:inline-block the horizontalscroll bar display, It's possible to remove the horizontal bar without using overflow-x:hidden
            
            When we add the more td,th means the horizontal scrollbar should come under static div not window/screen.
            
            Note: Not able to add anything in html. I can able to overwrite the css only. So please it's possible to change only in css.
            
            I added my code in jsfiddle: clik here
            
            It's simple to everyone but I am struggle little bit here.
